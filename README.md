# Face-Mask-Detection-Project
This project intends to develop a Face Mask Detection system using OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow and Deep Learning. The system can be easily integrated to various embedded devices with limited computational capacity as it uses MobileNetV2 architecture. It will detect face masks in images as well as in real-time videos.
