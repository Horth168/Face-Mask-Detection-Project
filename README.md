# Face-Mask-Detection-Project
This project intends to develop a Face Mask Detection system using OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning. The system can be easily integrated to various embedded devices with limited computational capacity as it uses MobileNetV2 architecture. It will detect face masks in images as well as in real-time videos.
# Face-Mask-Detection on Web-App Using Streamlit
In this project I use Streamlit as a web-app to execute our face mask detection on the website with CSS and for now I have only developed it using images for detecting the face mask. The webcam one is under development and will be released soon.
